## **Title: Process: Recording Architecture Decisions**

**Date:** 2025-07-04

**Status:** `Accepted`

---

### **Context**

It is necessary to formally document all application architecture decisions to ensure long-term maintainability and knowledge sharing within the team.

---

### **Decision**

For all architectural decisions, an Architecture Decision Log (ADL) will be maintained. All decisions will be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each ADR will be a Markdown file created and managed within a shared **Obsidian** vault. We will use the [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which includes the following sections: Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.

---

### **Consequences**

- All architectural decisions must be recorded in the log. Old decisions should be recorded retroactively with an approximate decision date.
- New decisions must be recorded on a regular basis.
- Team members will need access to the shared Obsidian vault to create, view, and link decision records.
- The use of Markdown files in Obsidian allows for easy linking between related decisions and straightforward version control (e.g., using Git).
