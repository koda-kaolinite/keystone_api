## **Title: Architectural Style: Modular Monolith**

**Date:** 2025-07-04

**Status:** `Accepted`

### **Context**

An initial architectural style must be chosen for the system that balances initial development velocity, deployment simplicity, and long-term scalability.

---

### **Decision**

We will adopt a **Modular Monolith** architecture, using the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to guide its internal structure.

This choice is a strategic decision that balances the need for cohesive initial development with foresight for future growth. Although the software has clear potential to expand into a microservices architecture, we are starting with a monolith to simplify deployment, infrastructure, and inter-component communication at this stage of the project.

Each system module will be developed as an autonomous component representing a DDD **Bounded Context**. This approach ensures low coupling and high cohesion, with each module responsible for a specific business domain. This not only organizes the code logically and in alignment with the business but also establishes the clear boundaries that will facilitate a planned and lower-risk extraction of modules into microservices in the future.

### **Consequences**

- The entire system will run as a single application process (Monolith).
- Despite being a monolith, modules will be designed for maximum autonomy (Modular).
- The primary method for dividing the monolith into modules will be DDD Bounded Contexts.
- DDD tactical patterns will be used for the implementation within most modules.
