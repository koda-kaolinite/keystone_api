## **Title: Enforcing Architecture with Automated Tests**

**Date:** 2025-07-04

**Status:** `Accepted` 

---

### **Context**

Our architecture defines many important rules (module boundaries, layer dependencies in Clean Architecture, etc.) that cannot be enforced by the Java compiler alone. Over time, without automated checks, the implemented code can diverge from the intended design, leading to architectural decay. Code reviews alone are not sufficient to catch all such violations consistently.

---

### **Decision**

We will implement a suite of **automated architecture tests** to programmatically enforce our design rules.

These tests will run as part of our continuous integration pipeline. We will use a dedicated library, **ArchUnit**, for this purpose. The tests will be organized into two categories:

1. **Global Architecture Tests:** A central test project will verify high-level rules, such as ensuring the Domain Layer has no dependencies on the Infrastructure Layer.
2. **Module-Specific Tests:** Each module will have tests to enforce its own boundaries, for example, to prevent another module from directly referencing its internal classes.

---

### **Consequences**

- **Governance & Documentation**
    
    - We get quick, automated feedback when an architectural rule is broken, preventing accidental coupling and design erosion.
    - The tests themselves serve as living, executable documentation of the system's architecture.
- **Implementation & Maintenance**
    
    - The suite of architecture tests will need to be maintained and updated as the architecture evolves.
    - For very specific or complex rules not covered by the library, we may need to write custom test logic using reflection.
- **Performance & Execution**
    
    - These tests are slightly slower than standard unit tests due to their use of reflection to analyze the codebase, but they are still fast enough for regular execution in the CI pipeline.
